                DataRight+: Enhanced Endpoint Versioning
         draft-authors-datarightplus-enhanced-versioning-latest

Abstract

   This specification outlines the technical components associated with
   the DataRight+ Enhanced Endpoint Versioning.  This is intended to be
   an alternate endpoint versioning scheme to that outlined with [CDS]
   which facilitates a more developer friendly response processing
   mechanism (by way of oneOf) and a deterministic request payload
   versioning mechanism.

1.  Scope

   The scope of this specification is specifically with regard to a
   standardised request and response versioning pattern for resource
   server endpoint paths as an alternate to that prescribed by [CDS].

2.  Terms & Definitions

   This specification uses the terms "Provider" and "Initiator" as
   defined by [DATARIGHTPLUS-ROSETTA].

3.  Introduction

   The [CDS] introduced an endpoint versioning scheme based on a
   negotiation pattern contained within the x-v and x-min-v headers.
   This effectively allows for dynamic response negotiation by the
   resource server between a range of available versions.  The
   challenges with this approach though is that the payloads themselves
   are not explicitly versioned, something oneOf in OpenAPI 3 lends
   itself to, and the payloads contained within POST requests are
   essentially unversioned.

   This specification seeks to solve for these two challenges by
   introducing an explicit version in both request and response
   payloads.  Further it seeks to retire the x-min-v header on the basis
   that such a negotiation pattern is unable to be applied to
   potentially multiple versions of a request payload.  Much of this
   specification assumes the adoption of the related
   [DATARIGHTPLUS-DISCOVERY] specification.

4.  Provider

   The following provisions apply to Provider Resource Server endpoints
   supporting this specification:

   1.  Response payloads SHALL be determined based on the x-v header
       specified in the request;
   2.  Response payloads SHALL include the version attribute in the
       response payload;
   3.  Response headers MAY include an x-v value matching the version
       attribute within the payload
   4.  Request payloads received using the HTTP POST method SHALL be
       processed by matching the version attribute to the appropriate
       OpenAPI specification
   5.  If a request is received containing a x-v value which is
       unsupported the server shall respond with a urn:au-cds:error:cds-
       all:Header/UnsupportedVersion error as outlined in [CDS]

5.  Initiator

   The following provisions apply to participants operating individual
   Initiators accessing endpoints supporting this specification:

   1.  Requests shall include an x-v header representing the requested
       response payload
   2.  Request payloads SHALL be constructed to contain the version
       attribute contained within the relevant OpenAPI specification
   3.  Response payloads SHALL be processed in accordance with the
       version attribute and the oneOf specification within the relevant
       OpenAPI specification
   4.  Responses containing an x-v header SHALL be validated to ensure
       the x-v and version values are the same

6.  Implementation Considerations

   For endpoints which are currently compliant to the [CDS] versioning
   schema the endpoint can be transitioned by incrementing the endpoint
   version while introducing the version attribute into the response
   and, if necessary, the request payloads.  In order to retire the use
   of x-min-v it is necessary to introduce a discovery document, as
   outlined in [DATARIGHTPLUS-DISCOVERY].
